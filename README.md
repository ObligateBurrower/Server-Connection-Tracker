This is a few scripts that will track various statistics from a traceroute to the Jagex server URLs. There is also a Shiny app that will display information regarding the data from the traceroutes. You can filter by region.

NOTE - Delete the traceroute_data.csv to start logging your own data. I have included mine to show a reference.
